1.) Web Development was a completely brand new subject to me before taking this class, So basically every new week we were introduced to a new topic, I learned something new. GitHub was challenging at first to use but towards the end I got the hang of it quite well including repositories

2.) Web Design was also completely new to me before taking this class. Everything I learned was completely new to me which made the whole class a-lot more interesting. Creating different web pages was challenging at first but super fun

3.) I overcame many challenges this year in this class due to simple miss understandings. The way I overcame most of these problems was to just proceed with trial and error until I figured it out and a-lot of the times I was lost this method worked.
