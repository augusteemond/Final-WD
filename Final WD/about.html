            This sneaker page is a blogspot where we can analize specific news in the sneaker
            industry and see if any gains or losses could be made from them. There is also a contact
            page which is linked to my email so if any fellow sneaker heads have any questions regarding
            the flipping of sneakers or questions that lay within the sneaker market specifically feel free
            to send me an email and I reach out to help or assist and whatever way I can.

            My name is Auguste Emond and I am a 20 year old sneeker head who is based in the North West.
            My love for sneakers became very stong at a young age. Ive always loved shoes and once I was able
            to start obatining my own money, I became very involved in the sneaker industry. Today I own over 20 pairs of shoes
            that I manage to fit in my shoebox size appartment. My most saught after sneaker is an OFF-White Jordan 1
            which is a white pair of shoes that released for 190 dollars. This shoe exclusivally released in europe, and
            now today the shoe goes for a little under 5 grand.

            For the majority of people, I feel its safe to say that shoes are probally not the most exicting
            thing in there life. But for myself and sneakerheads alike a pair of shoes dont really come off
            as a footwear item anymore, its viewed morso as a dollar sign, many of them infact. Because of this
            I cant help to notice footwear in the stores, online, and out in public on peoples feet.

            Becoming a sneaker head is much easeier than people make it out to be.Sneaker reselling is based on
            a simple concept that guides many other businesses: buy low, sell high. You'll want to figure out how
            to track expenses and figure out net profit on each pair sold. One entrepreneur who made over $125,000
            in sales since January 2019 has a bloggspot himself and posts up and comming new sneakers. You'll also want
            to figure out your strategy. While some people might prefer to invest in a few pairs and wait for them to grow in value, others utilize a high-volume sneaker resale strategy to make money by moving product quickly at slimmer margins. Lastly, it can be helpful to take a look at some up-and-coming sneaker resale websites to learn about new ways to make money in the industry.
