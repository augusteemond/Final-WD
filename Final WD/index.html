            Flipping sneakers has been a viable business proposition for decades. The demand side emerged as far
            back as 1985, when Nike dropped the Air Jordan 1, a culture-shifting sneaker that sold faster than the
            company could manufacture it. The supply side followed soon after, when some retailers began selling the
            few pairs they could get for more than Nike’s $64.95 suggested retail price. A year later, the company doubled down,
            limiting the initial release of the Air Jordan 2 to just 30 stores in 19 cities and adding $40 to the price. The Air Jordan 3,
            which marked the debut of Tinker Hatfield’s iconic “Jumpman” logo, was so popular that Nike has reissued it countless times
            without ever really satisfying demand. The advent of EBay in the mid-1990s brought nonretail sellers into the game,
            and the market only grew from there.

            Sneaker reselling holds so much promise because the market behind the shoes are so great and so hungry for more
            that most sneeker companys can almost predict when a recently released shoe will sell out. People tend to treat
            sneakers more so as stocks. The idea behind sneaker reselling is to buy low and sell high, identical to trading stocks.
            The sneaker head community has become so great because everyone loves shoes and everyone needs at least a pair, and because of the culture and
            all the hype raised behind sneekers itself, it eventually developed into the market it is today.

            Capitalizing on the power of the Jordan brand, Nike has been re-releasing the classic Air Jordans
            (models 1 through 14) over and over again. The Air Jordan 11, for example, has been released some 40 times over nearly 20 years — in different colors.
            Take all those classic models and colors, release them dozens of times in limited quantities, and you’ve got lines outside Foot Locker and other Nike
            retailers every Saturday morning. Shoe companys such as Nike and Adidas speciffically target these crounds of sneaker heads too enusre sell outs
            of any givin shoe.

            To know whether Nike could capture any of the millions of dollars consumers spend in the secondary market, it helps to understand why people want these
            sneakers in the first place. The existence of a secondary market in sneakers raises questions for economists and sneakerheads: Is it rational to sell
            a sneaker for $250 and let the buyer resell it for $8,000, earning a 3,000 percent return on his or her money? Could Nike capture any of that money?
        </div>

            Nike may be leaving money on the table, but the company certainly isn’t suffering. In fiscal 2014, it did $27.8 billion in sales — an increase of about
            10 percent from the previous year, not easy for a big company. Western Europe accounts for a lot of that growth, but North America, Nike’s largest market,
            also saw 10 percent growth. So in a sence by this secondary market being created, it both benifited the producer and consumer and allows for many
            sales trasactions on one specific product, which in this case is a pair of kicks
