              We stand behind all of our shoes and gear. If your Nike shoes or apparel develop a material or workmanship flaw within two years of the manufacture date, we want to get you back in the game.

If you believe your item is flawed, and it’s within 60 days of your purchase, you can simply return it to us for a full refund. For Nike.com and Nike App purchases, please see our return instructions (and if you want to try to exchange the item, you’ll need to give us a call). For Nike store purchases, you’ll want to take your item back to the store you bought it from.

If it’s been longer than 60 days, and less than two years since the manufacture date (located on the item’s tag), and the item has developed a flaw, here's what you need to do:

              A buyer may place a Bid on an item for sale through the Services. When a Bid matches an Ask, the buyer is obligated to pay for that item. WHEN YOU PLACE A BID, YOU ARE COMMITTING TO PURCHASE THE ITEM AS SOON AS YOUR BID MATCHES A SELLER’S ASK PRICE AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PAYMENT OF THE ASK PRICE WILL BE TAKEN FROM YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. To be an eligible buyer you must have a billing address and shipping address within one of the countries that StockX supports.

                StockX does not provide any guarantee that your items will sell and will not provide any compensation for items that do not sell through our Services. StockX also does not guarantee how long it will take for a listing to appear in the Services after it is posted and is not responsible for unsold items resulting from any listing delays. StockX conducts periodic scheduled maintenance as well as unscheduled emergency maintenance from time to time.

                The website acts as a middleman between buyers and sellers, making otherwise potentially shady resale market transactions safe and secure. StockX authenticates all products before they're sent to you, so you never have to worry about scammers and fake items.
